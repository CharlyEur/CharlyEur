- 👋 Hi, I’m @CharlyEur, software developer working from ~~France~~ home :)
- 👀 I’m interested in C# mainly, but still curious about C++ I practised a bit and of course Python and F# which are on my whishlist!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to manage a team AND a family at the same time (guess what: it is not _that_ simple)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mathematical issues but also useful tools for every developers in the worlds.
- 📫 How to reach me ... let's be shy a little longer ;)
